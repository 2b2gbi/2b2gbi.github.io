title: Bienville Update One
---

Hello Everyone!

Welcome to my new City Journal: Bienville, Missouri. Some of you may know me, most of you probably don't so I'll briefly introduce myself. My name is jon, and I have previously authored two City Journals, Insulo and Kaskaskia and the short-lived Progress. I would link them, but due to my usage of the now-defunct Majhost and a strange issue with another host I used none of the pictures work . This is the first City Journal I have made in very long time (five years, to be exact) and my first ever in Cities: Skylines, but I have very high hopes for this project, so I hope you enjoy what I have to share with you.

Before we dive into the pictures, let me first introduce you to the idea behind Bienville and some basic information about the city. My goal with this project is to recreate a realistic, detailed America city. I always intended this project to be based in the central part of the United States, and eventually decided on a location in Southeastern, Missouri along the Mississippi River South of the convergence of the Mississippi and the Ohio. I chose this region because I wanted to draw inspiration from several cities in this part of the country, chiefly my hometown of Kansas City, St. Louis, and Memphis. The specific location was chosen for its location on the Mississippi River and the sparse population of the area in reality.  The city is definitely around the size of Kansas City and St. Louis, but I haven't completely nailed down its population at this point. The city has historically been very dependent on the river and railroads for transportation, and is a major industrial center. The name of the city indicates its origins, it was founded in the late 18th century by French fur-traders operating in French Louisiana, and named for the explorer and French Colonial Governor Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville.

That should be enough information to get started. Eventually this journal will include a more detailed, Wikipeda-style information post about the city, but that's something I'm still working on. So, with all of that out of the way, let's get into the meat of this first update.

This first update will be the first of two or three updates focusing on two of the city's oldest districts, the River Market and Bertling Park. 

The first location we are going to visit is a great indication of the city's relationship with the river and its impacts on industry and transportation in the region. While Mississippi River shipping is not in its heyday, cargo-laden barges are still a common sight along the river. 

![Bootheel Chemical Company](https://i.imgur.com/IRl8KD9.jpg "The Bootheel Chemical Company")

Bootheel Chemicals Incorporated, founded in 1951 by a group of local businessmen, provides and transports a variety of chemical products throughout Southeastern Missouri, Western Kentucky, and Southern Illinois. This facility, located close to downtown Bienville, is a secondary shipping and storage facility with a dock on the river to allow for the transportation of chemicals in ships and barges along the Mississippi.

The facility is also serviced by a rail connection, allowing it access to three modes of transportation. It sits along Lemoyne Drive, a small industrial road that runs along the river outside of the cities formidable levee system. This location means that the facility requires protocols for the flooding that frequently occurs along the Mississippi. In this image we can also see a ship towing several barges upriver to other industrial facilities.

The next location featured today is a construction site in the River Market district.

![Girardeau Commons Construction](https://i.imgur.com/cJDvt8M.jpg "Giradeau Commons Construction")

Only a block away from the City market and directly adjacent to a streetcar station, this is prime real estate in one of the most popular neighborhoods in the city. Before it was purchased by a developer, the lot was home to a paid parking lot. The plans for the project have been a topic of fierce debate at City Hall, where neighborhood leaders lobbied against the original proposal for the site, a fourteen-story luxury apartment building, and forced the developers to alter their plans to something that better suited the character of the area.

![Interstate 224 Mississippi Ave Exit and Surroundings](https://i.imgur.com/WJuuSkx.jpg "Interstate 224 Mississippi Ave Exit and Surroundings")

The primary highway access to the River Market and Bertling Park districts in provided by Interstate 224, with exits at Mississippi Avenue, the first street inside the municipal levees, and Fifth Street. The interstate bisects Bertling Park, and is surrounded on each side by vacant, overgrown lots where proximity to the interstate has inhibited redevelopment since the raised portion of the highway through Bertling Park and bridge across the river were constructed in 1958. Mississippi Avenue, shown here, is serviced by an aging partial cloverleaf interchange that has become a popular shelter for the area's homeless population. In this image we are looking north toward the River Market over the westbound exits and several businesses positioned to attract motorists exiting the freeway. One of these businesses serves a local and regional favorite, barbecue. 

The scene is also situated at an access point to the districts from the Kentucky side of the river. 

![Strictoaster Cafe and Grand Boulevard](https://i.imgur.com/LaOEa2O.jpg "Strictoaster Cafe and Grand Boulevard")

The Bienville Strictoaster Cafe location is located at Grand Boulevard and First Street, at the end of the Pulitzer Bridge that carries US Route 86 across the Mississippi River. The heavy traffic that traverses this intersection prompted the city to construct a jughandle exit for the eastbound lanes. They accomplished this by converting a short stretch of Rue Sauvolle, named in honor of the first colonial governor of Louisiana, into  a one-way road, and the cafe sits in the center of that junction. Although the location makes the diner somewhat difficult to access, the exposure provided by the location's visibility on one of the city's busiest thoroughfares more than offsets this disadvantage.

![Levee Park and the Mississippi Village Development](https://i.imgur.com/0aEF9y9.jpg "Levee Park and the Mississippi Village Development")

Located along Mississippi Avenue near the border between the River Market and Bertling Park Districts, Levee Park is a relatively new city park created as part of an initiative to revitalize Bertling Park in the early 2000's. It provides walking and biking trails along with public spaces and a playground. It was well received by residents and has become a popular part of this transforming community. Across the street, another result of the district's revitalization can be seen. The Mississippi Village Development is a large complex of mid-range apartments constructed to take advantage of the neighborhood's emergence as a trendy arts district and the resulting increase in property value. The project, however, necessitated the demolition of two entire city blocks of mixed-use properties that were aging, but not in disrepair. The demolition and construction required for the complex was delayed for years by disputes between the developers, the city, and community leaders who vehemently opposed the project. Eventually, however, the project went ahead and was completed in 2016.


![The Bienville Public Library](https://i.imgur.com/XcgBKfE.jpg "Bienville Public Library")

The Bienville Public Library's main branch is located adjacent to Iberville Square, which has served as a public gathering place for much of the city's history. It resides in a large, richly-decorated 1887 structure that formerly served as the home of the Bienville Commodities Exchange. Inside, the library features an extensive collection of fiction and non-fiction works, along with an extensive genealogical collection, archives of local history, and the Bienville History Museum. It frequently hosts public events both in the library and on its grounds adjacent to the square.

The next two images focus on two recent, but very different, development projects located around what has historically been known as "The Junction," a three-way intersection where Grand Boulevard and Clemens Street converge at their crossing with Fourth Street.

![Market Square Development and Clemens Street](https://i.imgur.com/O25ga3P.jpg "Market Square Development and Clemens Street")

The first of these is the Market Square development, which features one mixed-use nine story tower, a 4 story residential building, and a connected three-level parking garage. This development marked the highest building built in the River Market district in many decades and was designed to have ample access to transit, including a street car station and bus stop directly adjacent to the property. This, coupled with its position within walking distance of the business district, Iberville Square, and the City Market make it a near perfect property for residents wanting independence from owning an automobile. It contrasts this distinction with its on-site parking garage, which is actually a public lot designed to provide greater access to Market Square and surrounding attractions. Among these is another development project that has received near-universal praise, a rare feat in the city, the Clemens Street Pedestrian Walk. This project, which has adopted the name "The Junction" from the meeting of the three streets, converted the short stretch of Clemens Street before it converges with Grand Boulevard and Fourth Street into a pedestrian street. A long plaza, complete with shade trees, replaced the roadway and buildings along the stretch were refurbished or renovated. The East end of the walk is capped by a small public park while the west end features a massive art installation looping above the walkway. 


![View East down Grand Blvd from Clemens Street Pedestrian Walk](https://i.imgur.com/0Eh6F7B.jpg "View East down Grand Blvd from Clemens Street Pedestrian Walk")

This project not only improved the conditions of this historic area, but it eliminated the three-way intersection that previously had been one of the most congested and dangerous junctions in the city. The old buildings now house trendy shops and restaurants and numerous loft apartments catering to people who want move back into the city from suburbs. These two development projects have been held up examples of revitalization projects done right in a city that has seen many controversial developments.

Finally, we have arrived at the beating heart of these districts and downtown as a whole.

![The City Market and Surroundings](https://i.imgur.com/KMvVLkl.jpg "The City Market and Surroundings")

The City Market, which is the reason this district is referred to as the river market, features a covered outdoor marketplace and a large indoor market hall. The market building, build in 1879 as a train station, is home to numerous permanent and temporary vendors and eateries, while the outdoor area hosts twice-weekly farmers markets flush with local produce. It is one of the busiest markets in the united States, and has operated continuously in this location since 1906. Its recent resurgence in popularity has been key to the emergence of the River Market as one of the most desirable neighborhoods in the city.

This brings the first update of Bienville to and end. I hope you all enjoyed this as much as I enjoyed creating it. Please share any ideas you have, any comments, or any criticisms. I also appreciate feedback. If you do like what you see, please take the time to rate this post and follow the journal so you see when I post the next update.

I am not sure yet how often updates will come, I'm hesitant to post a schedule with how long some things I want to do might take me and how unstable my game can be. I do have a second update close to completion, so that should be coming within a week or two. I have also considered trying to put together some video content or livestreams for this project. Let me know if you would like to see that. I do have some recording of what I've built already, but due to some issues with recording software I lost quite a bit of it.

Until next time, thanks for reading!
