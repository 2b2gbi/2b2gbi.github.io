title: Bienville Update One
---

Hello Everyone!

Welcome to my new City Journal: Bienville, Missouri. Some of you may know me, most of you probably don't so I'll briefly introduce myself. My name is jon, and I have previously authored two City Journals, Insulo and Kaskaskia and the short-lived Progress. I would link them, but due to my usage of the now-defunct Majhost and a strange issue with another host I used none of the pictures work . This is the first City Journal I have made in very long time (five years, to be exact) and my first ever in Cities: Skylines, but I have very high hopes for this project, so I hope you enjoy what I have to share with you.

Before we dive into the pictures, let me first introduce you to the idea behind Bienville and some basic information about the city. My goal with this project is to recreate a realistic, detailed America city. I always intended this project to be based in the central part of the United States, and eventually decided on a location in Southeastern, Missouri along the Mississippi River South of the convergence of the Mississippi and the Ohio. I chose this region because I wanted to draw inspiration from several cities in this part of the country, chiefly my hometown of Kansas City, St. Louis, and Memphis. The specific location was chosen for its location on the Mississippi River and the sparse population of the area in reality.  The city is definitely around the size of Kansas City and St. Louis, but I haven't completely nailed down its population at this point. The city has historically been very dependent on the river and railroads for transportation, and is a major industrial center. The name of the city indicates its origins, it was founded in the late 18th century by French fur-traders operating in French Louisiana, and named for the explorer and French Colonial Governor Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville.

That should be enough information to get started. Eventually this journal will include a more detailed, Wikipeda-style information post about the city, but that's something I'm still working on. So, with all of that out of the way, let's get into the meat of this first update.

This first update will be the first of two or three updates focusing on two of the city's oldest districts, the River Market and Bertling Park. 

The first location we are going to visit is a great indication of the city's relationship with the river and its impacts on industry and transportation in the region. While Mississippi River shipping is not in its heyday, cargo-laden barges are still a common sight along the river.

Bootheel Chemicals Incorporated, founded in 1951 by a group of local businessmen, provides and transports a variety of chemical products throughout Southeastern Missouri, Western Kentucky, and Southern Illinois. This facility, located close to downtown Bienville, is a secondary shipping and storage facility with a dock on the river to allow for the transportation of chemicals in ships and barges along the Mississippi.

The facility is also serviced by a rail connection, allowing it access to three modes of transportation. It sits along Lemoyne Drive, a small industrial road that runs along the river outside of the cities formidable levee system. This location means that the facility requires protocols for the flooding that frequently occurs along the Mississippi. In this image we can also see a ship towing several barges upriver to other industrial facilities.

The next location featured today is a construction site in the River Market district.

Only a block away from the City market and directly adjacent to a streetcar station, this is prime real estate in one of the most popular neighborhoods in the city. Before it was purchased by a developer, the lot was home to a paid parking lot. The plans for the project have been a topic of fierce debate at City Hall, where neighborhood leaders lobbied against the original proposal for the site, a fourteen-story luxury apartment building, and forced the developers to alter their plans to something that better suited the character of the area.
