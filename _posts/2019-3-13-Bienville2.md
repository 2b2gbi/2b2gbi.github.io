title: Bienville Update Two
---

Hello Everyone!

Welcome back for the second update of Bienville. It took a little longer than I intended due to some game issues and real life, but I hope you enjoy what i have to share. In this update we'll continue our tour of the River Market and Bertling Park districts of Bienville. If this is your first time reading, I recommend you go back to the first entry and read the introduction to the city and the districts we're exploring. 

Our first location today is an area inside the River Market District known as Gardner Mill. The neighborhood is named for a large textile mill that once occupied the area East of Second Street between New Madrid Street and Illinois Avenue.

The mill closed during the depression, and sat abandoned for years before being demolished in 1951. The neighborhood around it faced similar struggles, but ultimately most of the area avoided the fate of its namesake, and in the late 1970's became the center of Bienville's LGBT scene when several businesses catering to the community opened in the area.

The largest and most successful of these businesses is the Colours Nightclub, which has occupied a former hotel on St. Louis Street since 1978. A large mural decorates the eastern wall of the building, and has become an icon in Bienville. The buildings to the East of the club were destroyed by a fire in the 1940's and have since been replaced by an Exxon gas station and another Beinville instiution, Harlan's Famous Ice Cream.

The row of buildings across St. Louis Avenue from Colours is home to several local business, including a bar, health foods store, and a microbrewery. In recent years the craft beer scene in Bienville has exploded, and numerous breweries have opened throughout the city. This brewery features a brewpub and a large outdoor seating area, which has quickly become a popular gathering place in the neighborhood. 

The entire neighborhood is served by the Gardner Mill/Chouteau Park streetcar station, which allows easy access to the area's bars and clubs from around the city. In 2006 the city installed a unique, rainbow pattern crosswalk across St. Louis Avenue between several of the most popular venues in the neighborhood and added signals to increase safety at the crossing.

Another prominent feature of the neighborhood is Chouteau Park, a small park West of Second Street between St. Louis Avenue and Illinois Avenue. The gazebo in the park is a popular location for gatherings, ranging from birthdays to weddings. Just North of the park is the recently finished River Market Community Center, which provides residents with a variety of services and gym facilities. Father South down Second Street is the future site of the Gardner Commons, a mixed-use development slated to occupy the location of an office building damaged by fire last year. Currently the project is in the final stages of demolition, and is currently projected to be completed in sometime in late 2019.

One landmark in the River Market district is the Bienville Central Post Office, located at the junction of Grand Boulevard and Forth Street.

Constructed in 1911, the Beaux-Arts brick and limestone structure has been the primary post office for the city since it was built. In recent years, however, there has been discussion of moving the post office to a more modern and spacious facility elsewhere in the city.

Further to the East, Grand Avenue becomes US Route 86 and crosses the Mississippi via the Albert Neves Memorial Bridge, named for a former mayor and state senator.

The approach for the bridge begins at first street and carries the highway over Mississippi Avenue. Nestled against the bridge approach is Los Geckos, a popular local Mexican restaurant and bar. The large industrial building next to the restaurant is occupied by the offices of several companies, the largest of which is the Urban Deco architectural firm. This company has grown rapidly in recent years, and its projects can be seen throughout the city.

Following Mississippi Avenue to the South brings us to the Stuart Hall lofts, one of the largest converted industrial buildings in the River Market.

Formerly home to a cereal factory and then Stuart Hall Stationary Company, the building now houses a number of studio, one-bedroom, and two-bedroom apartments featuring exposed brick and rafters. It features an exercise room and an outdoor plaza with a pool. The building across Cairo Street from the lofts is still an active industrial building, and houses the warehouse of the Kruse Importing Company, which has occupied the space since 1909.

Now we will move even further South to explore the half of the Berling Park District that lies to the North of Interstate 224.

![North Bertling Park Commercial Strip](https://i.imgur.com/XJE9NRp.jpg "North Bertling Park Commercial Strip")

Most of the commercial activity lies along Mississippi Avenue between Kentucky Street and Bertling Street. Several local business occupy these buildings and attract clientele from the neighborhood and the traffic heading into the city from the Interstate. Behind this strip there are mostly residential buildings with some small restaurants and shops mixed in. The Holy Rosary Catholic Church, one of the largest landmarks in Bertling Park, lies just out of frame to the West.

Built in 1801 and reconstructed in 1866 after it was partially destroyed by fire, the church is one of the oldest standing buildings in the city. Its 170 ft spire towers over the surrounding buildings and its small cemetery is the final resting place of several prominent figures in the history of the city. For many years the church was the tallest building in Bienville.

We end this update with a view along Bertling Street at Third, near where Interstate 224 divides Berting Park in two. A businesses, like this Waffle House, have moved into this area, but in general this swath of Bertling Park has never recovered from the demolition of several blocks of housing to construct the interstate and the decreased property values from the proximity to the noisy thoroughfare. Much of the area was declared blighted by the city government in the 1980's and demolished, leaving behind large empty lots, some of which still sit vacant while others have been converted to parking lots, auto shops, or self-storage facilities.
