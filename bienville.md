### History

#### Early History

Founded in 1768 by French fur traders, the city grew steadily until the early 19th century, when the westward expansion of the United States and the growth of shipping along the Mississippi River allowed the city to flourish. Prior to the Civil War, immigrants from central Europe, especially modern-day Germany, came to Bienville in droves and became a significant part of the city's identity and culture. These groups originally settled in the historic Bertling Park neighborhood of the city, and have since spread throughout the metropolitan area. During the American Civil War and the preceding conflicts in Missouri and Kansas, Bienville was one of several strongholds of free state and pro-union sentiments in the bitterly divided state of Missouri.
